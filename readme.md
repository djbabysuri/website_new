# Queeri Data & Analytics Website Updates

This is a  descriptive breakdown of the qD&A website update. The website is being transitioned from a Google sites template over to a custom design. These are the component parts as of 11/05/2020.

## Current Components:

- [x] index.html- Home page complete
- [x] us.html- Description of work performed by company
- [x] you.html- Brief description of companies/organizations qD&A typically works with.
- [x] how.html- Brief desciprtion of how qD&A typically approaches problems/projects.

### Notes: Initial site updates are complete. Site is very text heavy. 

## Future Components:
* Swap out current form on "shall we?" page
* Swap out text for images. Considering using organization logo's in place of text on "you" page. Need permission to do so. Currently, the "project" page is using company logo as placeholders, should switch this out with more descriptive imagery.
